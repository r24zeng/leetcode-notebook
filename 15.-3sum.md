# 15. 3Sum

{% hint style="info" %}
Two pointers problem + one fixed pointer.

One pointer starts from the beginning of the list, the other one starts from the end of the list. The fixed pointer represents the one of the three elements.
{% endhint %}

### Solution:

1. Set one pointer `i`, from `0` to `len(nums)-2`
2. Set second pointer `j`, starting from `i+1`
3. Set third pointer `k`, starting from `len(nunms)-1`
4. `sum = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k]`
5. If `sum == 0`, add the three elements to result, and `j ++ & k --`; If `sum > 0`, `k --`; If `sum < 0`, `j ++`
6. Stop condition: while `j < k`.
7. In order to avoid duplication
   1. If `nums[i] == nums[i-1]`, skip this index.
   2. Set result as `set`, set the list as a `set` before adding it to the result. Because `nums` has been sorted, so don't need to consider duplication.
