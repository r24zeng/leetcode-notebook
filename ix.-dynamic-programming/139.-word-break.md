# 139. Word Break

{% hint style="success" %}
The problem is where to cut in this string. Record from start to end, if the substring `[0: i]` can do word break. The result is `[0: len(s)-1]`.
{% endhint %}

### Solution:

1. Define a list canSegement\[False\]\*\(len\(s\)+1\) to do DP, set canSegement\[0\]=True.
2. Two-layer for loop to fill in all elements of canSegment. Cut from \[0:i\], if substring before cut can segement and substring after cut is contained in wordDic, then canSegment\[i\]=True. 
3. canSegment\[len\(s\)\] is the result.

![Because canSegment\[j\] = True and {pe} is not in wordDic, then canSegment\[j\] = False.](../.gitbook/assets/1592363411998.jpg)
