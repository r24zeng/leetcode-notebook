# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

{% hint style="success" %}
Two pointers work together. One pointer points first element, the other one points third element.
{% endhint %}

### Solution 1:

1. Consider edge cases: less or equal than 2 elements
2. **Remove shouldn't be existed element**
3. Set `p1=0, p2=2`
4. `nums[p1] == nums[p2]` indicates the element is repreated 3 times, then `pop` it
5. `nums[p1] != nums[p2]`, then `p1` and `p2` just move forward one step

### Solution 2\(faster\):

1. Consider edge cases: less or equal than 2 elements
2. Set count=1, and track last element x
3. **Move should be existed element to correct position**
