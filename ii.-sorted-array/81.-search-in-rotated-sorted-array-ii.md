# 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II

### Solution:

1. Keep one of them when having repeated elements at the beginning and end of the list
2. Look for the pivot, which is to find the first pivot position. _\(In order to deal with two situations on time: it's an ascending list, it's a rotated list, always compare `mid` and `left` first which means keep the left side is an ascending list.\)_
3. Do binary search according to above two situations
4. Consider the edge case: 0 element

{% hint style="danger" %}
\[6,8,5,5,5\] and \[6,8,9,9,9\]

\[5,5,5,4\]  and \[4,5,5,5\]

When looking for the pivot, if value\(mid\) = value\(left\), keep right side
{% endhint %}

```python
while left + 1 < right:
    mid = left + (right - left)//2
    if nums[mid] >= nums[left]:
        left = mid
    else:
        right = mid
pivot = right
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Judging the list is an ascending or rotated list according to comparison of `nums[left]` and `nums[right]`, then do binary search at the same time
{% endhint %}

Time complexity: Because we can't confirm time complexity of step1. Except that step, time complexisty = $$O(lgN)$$
