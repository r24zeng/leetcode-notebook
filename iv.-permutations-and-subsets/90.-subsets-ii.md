# 90. Subsets II

{% hint style="danger" %}
For this problem, `[1, 4]` and `[4, 1]` are the same subsets
{% endhint %}

### Solution:

1. Sort the list to let same numbers be neighborhood.
2. Very similar to \#78. 
3. Add `if` inside the adding level process.

Time complexity = T\_mergeSort + T\_subsets =  $$O(NlgN) + O(2^n) = O(2^n)$$ 

Space complexity = $$O(n*2^n)$$
