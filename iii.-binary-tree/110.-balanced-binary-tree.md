# 110. Balanced Binary Tree

{% hint style="success" %}
1. Both of left and right subtrees are balanced?
2. max depth difference between left and right &lt;= 1?
{% endhint %}

### Solution 1:

1. Write maxDepth function to get the max depth of left and right subtrees
2. In main function, recusive to see each layer's balance and compute left and right maxDepth difference

### Solution 2:

Help function: if one of left and right subtree is not balanced, or max depth difference &gt; 1, return -1; otherwise return maxDepth.

Main function: return `true` or `false` accoding to help function.
