# 186. Reverse Words in a String II

> Given an input string __, reverse the string word by word. 
>
> Example:
>
> ```python
> Input:  ["t","h","e"," ","s","k","y"," ","i","s"," ","b","l","u","e"]
> Output: ["b","l","u","e"," ","i","s"," ","s","k","y"," ","t","h","e"]
> ```
>
> Note: 
>
> * A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
> * The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
> * The words are always separated by a single space.
>
> Follow up: Could you do it _in-place_ without allocating extra space?

Key idea: reverse individual word, then reverse the whole string.
